# What

bash solutions to CTF challenges

# Why

1. In order to become the next hokage, I must first become 1337 h4x0r.
2. It's called bash because it makes me wanna bash my head against a wall, so
   forcing myself to use it makes me a better h4x0r. No python allowed!
3. Practice [radare2](https://github.com/radareorg/radare2) for ROP.
